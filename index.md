## About Me

I am a first-year PhD student at **Sun Yat-sen University (SYSU)**, advised by Yanghui Rao. My research focuses on **large language models (LLMs)** and **data mining**, with applications in academic knowledge graphs, sentiment analysis, and anomaly detection. Currently, I am interning at **Zhipu.ai**, working on cutting-edge AI technologies.

Before joining SYSU, I earned my Master's (2020-2023) and Bachelor's (2016-2020) degrees in **Computer Science and Technology** from **North China Electric Power University (NCEPU)**.
